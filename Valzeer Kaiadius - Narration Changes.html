"There are only five, Valzeer,
1, Your actions may never go against the will of my beloved Seelie Court.
2, You mustn't lie to me nor any member of the Seelie Court as you must stay in our good will.
3, You cannot deny any invitation of mine or the Court.
4, You must help any Fae in need, barring they do not stand against the Court.
5, And lastly, and possibly the most important," she said, placing a finger on Valzeer's chin to capture his full attention, "you must compliment me upon any occasion I grace you with my presence." A small chuckle escaped her lips.



By the time Valzeer was born, his father, Crysis Chi-ah-dee-us, had already ascended to the esteemed position of leed judge in the sprawling city of Balldur's Gate. This prestigious role elevated their family to the ranks of high-ranking nobility, granting them a life of privilege in the upper city.

Growing up, Valzeer's mother, Nyssa, would regale him with tales of her and Crysis' younger days. She spoke of a time before they were respected nobles, a time when they faced relentless discrimination and cruelty due to their tee-flihng heritage. These shared hardships forged a bond between them and fueled Crysis' ambition to become a champion for equality and fairness for all races in Feyruin.

However, as Crysis climbed the ranks of Balldur's Gate's judiciary, he became increasingly consumed by his work, leaving little time for his family. Valzeer's interactions with his father were often limited to stern lectures and harsh discipline, as Crysis pushed him relentlessly to follow in his footsteps.

Nyssa would try to console her son, assuring him that his father wasn't always so cold and distant. She explained that the burdens of his position had taken a toll on him over the years, hardening his heart and warping his priorities.

As Valzeer grew older, he began to eavesdrop on the grim tales his father would share with Nyssa after returning home from work. He learned of the horrors that lurked in the shadows of Balldur's Gate, the monstrous acts committed by those who sought to exploit and oppress others. While Crysis saw these as mere cases to be judged and punished, Valzeer felt a growing disgust for his father's cold detachment and lack of empathy. He found solace and understanding in his mother's warmth and compassion.

One fateful day, as Valzeer returned home from school, he heard his mother's screams echoing through the house. He rushed to her side, only to find her lying on the floor, a pool of blood spreading around her. A hulking figure stood over her, tearing at her horns and spewing hateful words.

Paralyzed with fear and shock, Valzeer could only watch as his father stormed into the room and tackled the intruder. A fierce struggle ensued, but Crysis eventually subdued the attacker. He then turned to Valzeer and barked, "Call the guard! Tell them there's a killer!"

"I, I, I'll kill him!" Valzeer stammered, grabbing one of his mother's fallen horns and lunging towards the assailant.

"Boy!" Crysis shouted, his voice filled with disapproval. The last thing Valzeer saw was a flash of his father's boot before he was knocked unconscious.

When he awoke, he found himself surrounded by city guards, their faces grim as they meticulously examined the scene. Nyssa's body lay lifeless on the floor, a pool of blood staining the rug beneath her. Her horns laying next to her, leaving behind jagged wounds that bore witness to the brutality of her murder.

In a panic Valzeer snatched his mother's horns from the pool of blood and ran, only grabbing what else he could carry from the family vault.

He sought refuge in the Cloakwood Forest, south of Balldur's Gate, living as a nomadic outcast. He survived on the money he had taken from his father's vault, but his heart ached for his mother. Each night, he clutched her horns to his chest, imagining conversations with her, seeking solace in her memory.

One moonless night, as he sat on a moss-covered stump, whispering to his mother's horns, he heard a rustle in the undergrowth. He looked up, startled, to see a figure emerging from the shadows.

To his astonishment, it was his mother, standing before him in the moonlight. "M-Mother?" he gasped, dropping to his knees and releasing the horns.

But before he could embrace her, the figure transformed, dissolving into a whirlwind of faerie dust. In her place stood a breathtaking woman with flowing red hair and eyes that shimmered like starlight.

"Figures," she chuckled, a mischievous glint in her eyes. "The one time in a hundred years I visit the mortal plane for a bit of fun, the mortal I encounter is a weirdo. I appear as your most desired woman in that spell, and it's your mother?"

Valzeer scrambled to his feet, clutching the horns protectively. "My mother?" he repeated, confusion clouding his mind. "Who are you? Why did you appear as her?"

"Well," she said, taking a seat on the stump Valzeer had vacated, "it's not supposed to go like that. The goal of that illusion is to fill you simple mortals with an irresistible lust. But that, has never happened before." She paused, her eyes narrowing as she noticed the horns in Valzeer's hands. "Are those hers? Your mother's, I mean."

"Yes," Valzeer replied, his voice trembling.

"Relax," the woman said, rising from the stump as Valzeer drew a dagger. "You've ruined the mood, and," she continued, stepping towards him and the blade slowly, "you're not even equipped to hurt me."

Her next step plunged the dagger into her stomach, but she remained unfazed. Leaning in, she whispered, "Let alone get away from me."

Valzeer jerked back, ripping the dagger from her stomach where it looked as if nothing had happened. It was as if the knife had passed through to another dimension rather than into her body.

He dropped the dagger but still clutched his mother's horns. "What do you want?"

"I want many things, Valzeer, but you've piqued my interest. Tell me, what happened to your mother?"

Hesitantly Valzeer answered, "She was murdered, for no reason of her own, about a year ago..."

"The reason of who then? You?"

"No! I'd never! I would never put anything before her..."

Her interest grew as she saw a similar devotion to her court in Valzeer's dedication to his mother. "Then who?"

"My father! It was always work first. He never cared for what that might entail for the rest of his family; just as long as he was a well-looked-upon lord."

Verenestra's eyes flashed with recognition. Valzeer's father's poor prioritization of family mirrored her own mother's neglect of the Seelee Court.

"Wait," Valzeer interrupted, "how do you know my name?"

"Well, you see, Valzeer, I'm Verenestra, princess of the Seelee Court, daughter of Ohburon and Titania, an Archfey. So, if there's something I need to know about in your realm, it'd be hard-fought to keep it a secret from me or my faeries."

As she mentions faeries, a childish giggle erupted from Valzeer's shoulder. He looked up, startled, to see a pixie perched there, grinning impishly.

"But what I didn't know, Valzeer, is how aligned our current situations are. You see my mother, the queen, I fear has lost sight of her true priorities and has begun putting her own desires above those of the Seelee Court. I think we both have something that could help the other."

"I already know never to accept a deal with a Fae," Valzeer countered. "You won't really bring my mother back, and you have nothing else I want."

"Don't be so closed-minded, Valzeer," Verenestra chided. "I possess what you need to right wrongs... Power. Wouldn't you like to be able to stand up to your father, that tyrant Lord Crysis? Or what happens when you're in the forest, like today, and a creature less kind than me is so lucky to find you?"

"Then it would be my time, and so be it."

"Tisk, Tisk, Tisk," Verenestra tutted. "You would rather be a leaf in the wind than the gust itself?"

"I won't defile death."

"I'm not asking you to defile it. I'm asking you to meet it head-on with that passion that burns within your tee-flihng blood!"

"And what do you get then, fae? Speak plainly."

"I want the same thing. When death or dismay rivals me or my beloved Seelee Court, you must answer the call."

Valzeer, having heard of both the Seelee and Unseelee Courts in passing conversations with his father, knew they were forces beyond simple good and evil.

Verenestra extended her hand towards Valzeer, and two objects materialized in the palm of her hand: a shimmering set of studded leather armor and a smooth, wooden amulet.

"This armor," she began, gesturing towards the leather, "is Glamoured Studded Leather. It will shift and change to match your desires, ensuring you always present yourself in a manner befitting a servant of the Seelee Court."

Verenestra's voice held a hint of vanity, but her eyes sparkled with amusement.

"And this," she continued, holding up the amulet, "is an Imbued Wood Focus of Shavarran Birch, a sacred wood from the heart of the Feywild. Channel your power through it, and let it amplify your magic and connect you to our realm."

Valzeer's eyes widened as he reached out to take the gifts. The leather felt cool and supple against his skin, and the amulet pulsed with a warm, comforting energy.

"I could even allow you to carry your mother close by, forever," Verenestra added softly while reaching out to touch the horns. With a wave of her hand, they vanished, then reappeared on Valzeer's forehead, nestled beside his own horns.

A slight tingling sensation burned on Valzeer's head, his eyes widened at the feeling of his mother's horns.

"What are the laws of this pact?" he asked, his voice filled with newfound determination.

"There are only five, Valzeer,

1, Your actions may never go against the will of my beloved Seelee Court.
2, You mustn't lie to me nor any member of the Seelee Court as you must stay in our good will.
3, You cannot deny any invitation of mine or the Court.
4, You must help any Fae in need, barring they do not stand against the Court.
5, And lastly, and possibly the most important," she said, placing a finger on Valzeer's chin to capture his full attention, "you must compliment me upon any occasion I grace you with my presence." A small chuckle escaped her lips.

Valzeer searched her eyes for any sign of malice or sarcasm, but her bright, depthless gaze revealed nothing.

He looked up at his mother's horns with pride and finally spoke, "Deal."

Immediately, Verenestra's energy shifted from serious to whimsical as she spun around, surrounded by pink whirling magic.

"Wonderful, truly, Valzeer! However I must go now, so we will talk again soon. But," she said with a heightened emphasis, as if expecting something, "before I go..."

She struck a pose, her eyes closed, waiting for Valzeer to speak.

"Thank you?" he offered tentatively.

"NO, VALZEER! THE FIFTH LAW!" she boomed, her voice echoing through the forest.

Valzeer's hair stood on end as chills ran through his body. He bowed his head quickly, muttering, "You look gorgeous, Miss Verenestra."

"Hmm, get better at that," her voice said, but when Valzeer looked up, she was gone.
